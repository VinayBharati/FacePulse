FacePulse â€“ Ensuring Live Users for Secure Authentication

Developed a Face Recognition Login System using Django, incorporating an advanced anti-spoofing mechanism with YOLO (You Only Look Once). The system offers a faster and more secure authentication method by detecting live users and preventing spoofing attempts such as using photos or videos. The project integrates facial recognition, live detection, and a user-friendly interface for a seamless and secure login experience.
